# Project 6 - *TranslateMe*

Submitted by: **Anthony Irizarry**

**TranslateMe** is an app that allows the user to enter any word and translate it into Spanish.

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users open the app to a TranslationMe home page with a place to enter a word, phrase or sentence, a button to translate, and another field that should initially be empty
- [x] When users tap translate, the word written in the upper field translates in the lower field. The requirement is only that you can translate from one language to another.
- [x] A history of translations can be stored (in a scroll view in the same screen, or a new screen)
- [x] The history of translations can be erased
 
The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Add a variety of choices for the languages
- [x] Add UI flair

## Notes

- The only issue I had was correctly implementing Firebase features to store the saved translations.
